# Github users

This Application is written in React, using Bootstrap to speed up styling the various elements.

The idea of the application is to utilise Githubs V3 API to display a searchable list of users. When clicking on those users you should be able to see a list of repositories and recent activity for that user.

To run the code locally:

1. clone the repository
2. `cd` into the root directory of the application.
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm start`

There are some tests in the application but not as many as I would have liked due to time constraints. To run these run `npm run test`

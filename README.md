# Github Users

This application is a demo showcasing how to work with the the Github API in a React Application.

The application displays a searchable list of Github users and allows you to view their repositories and recent activity.

To run the application locally: 
1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into the root directory of the application.
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm start` and then go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

Or if you would like to see a running version of the application you can do so here: [https://quiet-reef-28955.herokuapp.com/](https://quiet-reef-28955.herokuapp.com/)

There are some tests in this project but not as many as I would have liked due to time constraints, to run these run `npm run test` in your terminal window.

With regards to the activity stream, for the moment only a few of the 40+ Event Types have been covered, but can be extended to cover more with more time.
